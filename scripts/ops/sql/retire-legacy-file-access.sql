-- Explicit data cleanup for installations initialized before file management was
-- removed (2026-09-21; storage/file-avatar capabilities move to dedicated services).
-- Run with: psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f sql/patches/20260921_drop_file_storage.sql.
-- Atomic and repeatable; never invoked by service startup or admin init.
--
-- Scope: DATA only. The schema removal (DROP TABLE "files"; ALTER TABLE "sys_users"
-- DROP COLUMN "avatar") is an Atlas migration and must be applied separately via
-- scripts/atlas.sh (see docs/file-storage-removal-plan.md 阶段 2.11 / 3.5).
-- The enum-valued columns (sys_apis.module, sys_apis.business_module,
-- sys_plan_modules.module) are character varying, not native PG enums, so removing
-- the FILE value needs no type change — only the row deletes below.
